## STATUS

Runs on: Linux.

native-lib-loader is not working as expected (not loading libs from os/arch dependent paths),
open issue at https://github.com/scijava/native-lib-loader/issues/15.

JNI and JNA ok, only JNA loads the native libs from jars seamlessly.

In the simple case of an increment function implemented in C and called from Java, the JNI way is about 15 times faster
than using JNA.

The not as simple case of calling a C function to return the sum of an int array of length 4, shows a smaller difference:
JNI is faster than JNA by a factor of 3. This is most likely due to how JNI access the int[] at the native level, which
includes releasing pointers and stuff. There might be faster ways to do this with JNI.

btw: the "us/op" (microseconds per operation) actually mean "microseconds per 1000 native function calls", so a call
to the native increment function via JNI takes around 12 nanoseconds on an Intel Core i5 750.
