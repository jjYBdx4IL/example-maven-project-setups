ST-JS is a JavaScript generator that generates JavaScript from your Java code.
However, it does not do so for your existing Java code because it requires
you to use specific ST-JS extensions/classes. You cannot even use a java.util.Set!

I set up this example to explore ST-JS because GWT makes all sorts of problems
everytime I try to leave a trodden path. However, writing Java code
specifically for JavaScript seems odd to me, and the ST-JS extensions
basically constitute a language of their own. I'd rather start learning
TypeScript instead... or find a way around my GWT issues.
